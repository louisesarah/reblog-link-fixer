# Reblog Link Option for Tumblr

Extension to add an option to change the click-through link on reblogged/draft photos on Tumblr.

Some users who post photos, art or other such content without attributing a source occasionally set a click-through link on the content to direct traffic to a non-source, such as their blog. This extension allows you to change that link, while keeping the content source link (the original poster) the same.

In the Chrome Extensions page, you can load the files as an unpacked extension. A browser icon allows for turning the script on and off. Once in Tumblr, select the icon once to turn the script on for the current browser tab (when you reload or leave the page, the extension defaults to off). When you reblog a photo, hover the mouse over the photo window and the option to set a click through link will appear.

To use as a userscript: simply drag the script into the extensions page in the Chrome browser.

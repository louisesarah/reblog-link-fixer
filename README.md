# Reblog Link Option for Tumblr

Currently a userscript, simply drag the script into the extensions page in the Chrome browser. Once in Tumblr, when you reblog a photo, hover the mouse over the photo window and the option to set a click through link will appear. The content source link will remain the same.

[If this placeholder is visible, the extension background.js and manifest.json to enable toggle buttons (toggle the script on/off) have not run successfully yet]

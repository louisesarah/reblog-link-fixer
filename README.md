# Reblog Link Option for Tumblr

In the Chrome Extensions page, you can load the files as an unpacked extension. A browser icon allows for turning the script on and off. Once in Tumblr, select the icon once to turn the script on for the current browser tab (when you reload or leave the page, the extension defaults to off). When you reblog a photo, hover the mouse over the photo window and the option to set a click through link will appear. The content source link will remain the same.

To use as a userscript: simply drag the script into the extensions page in the Chrome browser.
